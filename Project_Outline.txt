An expense tracker is a tool or application used to record and monitor daily spending. 
It helps users manage their finances by categorizing expenses, setting budgets, and analyzing spending habits over time. 
Although manual tracking of the expenses could a hassle and a bit problematic if the item was lost. This is why I want to develop
a python based made expense track to track it digitally.

With that said, this outline will help me build the expense tracker in mind:

1. Have the user to input their expenses

2. Track date, category, amount, and description of expenses.

3. View all expenses.

4. Filter expenses by date/category.

5. Calculate total spent in a given period/category.

6. Save and load data (e.g., CSV or JSON format).
